## What is Quotex?

Quotex is a binary options trading platform that allows traders to
speculate on the price movements of different assets, such as
currencies, stocks, commodities, and indices.

## Is Quotex Halal?

The answer to this question is not straightforward. There are different
opinions among Islamic scholars on the permissibility of binary options
trading.

Some scholars argue that binary options trading is a form of gambling
and is, therefore, haram. This is because binary options trading
involves betting on the future price of an asset, which is considered to
be a form of speculation.

Other scholars argue that binary options trading is permissible if it is
done in a way that complies with Islamic principles. These scholars
argue that binary options trading can be used as a way to hedge against
risk or to generate income.
